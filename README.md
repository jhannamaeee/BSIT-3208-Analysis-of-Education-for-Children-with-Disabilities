# Analysis of Education for Children with Disabilities

## Introduction
Over the past two decades, remarkable progress has been made in expanding access to education, but evidence suggests many children with disabilities are still being left behind. Without ensuring quality education for children with disabilities and other marginalized groups, the world will not be on track to meet Sustainable Development Goal 4 to achieve quality education for all.  

In the popular mind, childrens with disabilities are usually identified with very low expectations. Parents should believe in the value of educating children with disabilities. The higher the expectations, the higher will be their acceptance in the family. All the children with disabilities must be enrolled in primary schools. After the assessment of their disabilities by a team of a doctor, a psychologist, and a special educator, in schools, the child will be placed in appropriate educational settings. Children with mild and moderate disabilities of any kind may be integrated in normal schools, severe in special schools/ remedial schools, dropouts who have problems in availing benefits of normal schools can join open schools. All the children with learning disabilities alone are first managed in the normal schools. Open and special schools also offer vocational courses also for children with disabilities.

Children with disabilities are 10 times less likely to attend school than those without. Even if they attend school, they are more likely to drop out early while the level of schooling they receive is frequently below that of their peers. In addition, there is a limited understanding within their communities and among teachers about their learning needs, which is often fuelled by prejudices around disability.

A child has special educational needs if they have a learning problem or disability that makes it more difficult for them to learn than most children their age. They may have problems with schoolwork, communication or behavior. Parents can get help and advice from specialists, teachers and voluntary organizations. In 2019–2020, the number of students ages 3–21 who received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was 7.3 million, or 14 percent of all public school students. Among students receiving special education services, the most common category of disability (33 percent) was specific learning disabilities.

## Problem Statement
Children with disabilities and/or handicaps are not treated fairly and do not have a voice. Many individuals harass children with disabilities at school and do not treat them properly; it used to be far worse. Now, children with impairments have their own lunch time and classrooms, so others won't bother them or be bothered by them. Children with disabilities are typically the last in line for resources and services, which are already insufficient. They are frequently the recipients of pity or, worse, prejudice and abuse." It's sad that so many people are aware that children with disabilities are mistreated and do nothing about it. Disabled children, despite their differences, can learn; all they require is the implementation of appropriate teaching and evaluation procedures. The ability to integrate those adjustments might lead to improved outcomes for disabled students.

## Significance of the Proposed Project
This study aims to provide the analysis of education for the children who have special needs. It is undeniable that education is critical for all children, particularly those with disabilities and limited social and economic opportunities. The special education system improved access to public school for children with disabilities. Aside from that, the special education system has provided them with an appropriate framework for their education, as well as allowing the institutions involved to identify children with disability sooner. As a result, children with disabilities are more likely to be included alongside their non-disabled peers.

This study intends to explore on the services provided to students with disabilities, as well as the impact of these services have on their educational and professional ambitions. It will look into whether the challenges faced by special needs children are related to how effective policies are in meeting their needs. This study is important to children with disabilities because it can help them learn about the educational opportunities accessible to them, as well as the institutions they can turn to for financial assistance and the treatment they should expect from society.

## Methods
In this study we use a qualitative approach to explain things in order to uncover patterns and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed. Recent study looks into new international trends in the education of children with disabilities, as well as their historical background. This descriptive study consists of the necessity of changing methods from special education to inclusive education. Our main purpose is to develop new trends rather than simply presenting the current trend toward inclusive education. Semi-structured  interview was  chosen  as  the methodological approach since they provide reliable and comparable qualitative data and also allow informants the freedom  to express  their views  in their  own  terms. With  the  help  of a semi-structured  questionnaire,  the experiences  and  perceptions  of  head-teachers,  teachers and  teacher  conductors  in  special/segregated  and inclusive schools were collected. 

## Expected Output
Every child has the right to the same opportunities as others, regardless of the difficulties they face. Special education is of great importance for children with learning disabilities, because it gives them the opportunity to get quality education in line with their unique needs. Special education enables every student to gain a high level of independence and reach their full potential.  This provides a legal framework for all issues related to the lives of persons with disabilities, and it includes explicit language stating that children with disabilities have the right to receive education in an inclusive setting and with the supports needed to succeed. The extent to which children with disabilities are deprived, feel discriminated against, and lack hope for the future demonstrates that societies are not doing enough to ensure that all children's most basic human rights are realized. As a result, the vicious cycle of exclusion and disadvantage that leaves children with disabilities behind continues. It must be a top priority to include children with disabilities in all parts of life. Every child, no matter where they are, has something to contribute. His or her talents, ideas, and energies have the potential to positively impact families, communities, and the world. The study aims to promote the global inclusion of children and young people with disabilities by ensuring that they are counted, consulted, and taken into account when making decisions.

The researchers will create a database about education for children with disabilities. This database will also help the parents/guardians with children who has disabilities. This is also to improve awareness of children as well as to enriches their minds. The researchers will create a database to provide children an activity that will develop their self-esteem, self-love, as well as boost their confidence. Children and parents/guardians will benefit from this program because it will help them perform better and stimulate action and creativity. Some of the objectives are to identify a good education for children with disabilities, to understand the concept of schooling needed by children with disabilities, as well as determining the importance of resolving children with disabilities problems. The involvement of this database is facilitated by the Researchers coordinator team.

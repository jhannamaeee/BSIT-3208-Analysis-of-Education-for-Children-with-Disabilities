# Analysis of Education for Children with Disabilities

## Introduction
Over the past two decades, remarkable progress has been made in expanding access to education, but evidence suggests many children with disabilities are still being left behind. Without ensuring quality education for children with disabilities and other marginalized groups, the world will not be on track to meet Sustainable Development Goal 4 to achieve quality education for all.  

In the popular mind, childrens with disabilities are usually identified with very low expectations. Parents should believe in the value of educating children with disabilities. The higher the expectations, the higher will be their acceptance in the family. All the children with disabilities must be enrolled in primary schools. After the assessment of their disabilities by a team of a doctor, a psychologist, and a special educator, in schools, the child will be placed in appropriate educational settings. Children with mild and moderate disabilities of any kind may be integrated in normal schools, severe in special schools/ remedial schools, dropouts who have problems in availing benefits of normal schools can join open schools. All the children with learning disabilities alone are first managed in the normal schools. Open and special schools also offer vocational courses also for children with disabilities.

Children with disabilities are 10 times less likely to attend school than those without. Even if they attend school, they are more likely to drop out early while the level of schooling they receive is frequently below that of their peers. In addition, there is a limited understanding within their communities and among teachers about their learning needs, which is often fuelled by prejudices around disability.

A child has special educational needs if they have a learning problem or disability that makes it more difficult for them to learn than most children their age. They may have problems with schoolwork, communication or behavior. Parents can get help and advice from specialists, teachers and voluntary organizations. In 2019–2020, the number of students ages 3–21 who received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was 7.3 million, or 14 percent of all public school students. Among students receiving special education services, the most common category of disability (33 percent) was specific learning disabilities.

## Problem Statement
Children with disabilities and/or are handicapped are not getting treated well and are not getting a say. In school many people bully children with disabilities and aren’t treating them the appropriate way, before it was worse. Now children with disabilities have their own time for their own lunch and their own classes so others won’t disturb them and/or be disturbed by them. Children with disabilities are among the last in line for resources and services, especially where these are scarce to begin with. Far too regularly, they are the objects simply of pity or, worse, discrimination and abuse.” It’s sad how many people know children with disabilities aren’t getting treated well and doing nothing about it. Being different, disabled students also can learn, they just need specific methods for teaching and assessment to be implemented. The possibility to incorporate those changes may lead to more successful results of disabled students.

## Significance of the Proposed Project
This study aims to provide the analysis of education for the children who have special needs. The importance of education for all children, especially for those with disabilities and with limited social and economic opportunities, is indisputable. Indeed, the special education system allowed children with disabilities increased access to public education. Apart from that, the special education system has provided for them an effective framework for their education, and for the institutions involved to identify children with disability sooner. In turn, this promotes greater inclusion of children with disabilities alongside their nondisabled peers.

This study intends to explore on the services offered to students with disabilities, and the outcomes of these services to their education and career goals. It will examine if the obstacles faced by special needs children have to do with how effective the policies are in addressing the needs of such children. This study is important to children with disabilities because it can help them discover the education opportunities available for them, the institutions they can rely on for economic support, and the treatment they should expect from society. 

## Methods
In this research we use a qualitative approach to explore how special education in the world has evolved . We describe phenomena systematically to reveal patterns and connections that might otherwise go unnoticed. Recent research investigates the new international trends occurring regarding the education of children with disabilities and their historical background. This descriptive study consists of the necessity of changing methods from special education to inclusive education. Our main purpose is to evolve new trends versus present the new trend toward inclusive education. Semi-structured  interview was  chosen  as  the methodological approach since they provide reliable and comparable qualitative data and also allow informants the freedom  to express  their views  in their  own  terms. With  the  help  of a semi-structured  questionnaire,  the experiences  and  perceptions  of  head-teachers,  teachers and  teacher  conductors  in  special/segregated  and inclusive schools were collected. 

## Expected Output
Every child has the right to the same opportunities as others, regardless of the difficulties they face. Special education is of great importance for children with learning disabilities, because it gives them the opportunity to get quality education in line with their unique needs. Special education enables every student to gain a high level of independence and reach their full potential.  This provides a legal framework for all issues related to the lives of persons with disabilities, and it includes explicit language stating that children with disabilities have the right to receive education in an inclusive setting and with the supports needed to succeed. The extent to which children with disabilities are deprived, feel discriminated against and lack hope for the future makes it clear that societies are not doing enough to realize the most basic human rights of all children. As a result, the vicious cycle of exclusion and disadvantage that leaves children with disabilities behind continues. Including children with disabilities in all aspects of life must be a priority. Every child, everywhere, has something to offer. His or her energies, talents and ideas can make a positive difference to families, communities and the world. The report seeks to increase the inclusion of children and young people with disabilities worldwide by ensuring they are counted, consulted and considered in decision-making.
